#Autosnort script for Ubuntu 18.04+
#Please note that this version of the script is specifically made available for students of Building Virtual Labs training on networkdefense.io, as well as the book, Building Virtual Machine Labs: A Hands-On Guide
#This work is based on the documentation written by Noah Dietrech for installing Snort 3 on Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04: https://snort.org/documents/snort-3-1-0-0-on-ubuntu-18-20
#This script will configure Snort

#Functions, functions everywhere.

# Logging setup. Ganked this entirely from stack overflow. Uses FIFO/pipe magic to log all the output of the script to a file. Also capable of accepting redirects/appends to the file for logging compiler stuff (configure, make and make install) to a log file instead of losing it on a screen buffer. This gives the user cleaner output, while logging everything in the background, for troubleshooting, analysis, or sending it to me for help.
